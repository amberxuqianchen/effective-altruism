We fitted a Bayesian linear mixed model (estimated using MCMC sampling with 4 chains of 2000 iterations and a warmup of 1000) to predict neg with k_other, moral and agency (formula: neg ~ k_other + moral + agency). The model included participant_ID as
random effect (formula: ~1 | participant_ID). Priors over parameters were all set as normal (mean = 0.00, SD = 2.10; mean = 0.00, SD = 1.66; mean = 0.00, SD = 4.11) distributions. The model's explanatory power is substantial (R2 = 0.31, 95% CI [0.26,
0.36], adj. R2 = 0.25) and the part related to the fixed effects alone (marginal R2) is of 0.16 (95% CI [0.11, 0.20]). The model's intercept, corresponding to k_other = 0, moral = 0 and agency = Other, is at 0.75 (95% CI [0.66, 0.84]). Within this model:

  - The effect of k other (Median = -0.02, 95% CI [-0.10, 0.06]) has a 69.15% probability of being negative (< 0), 31.30% of being significant (< -0.04), and 0.00% of being large (< -0.25). The estimation successfully converged (Rhat = 0.999) and the indices
are reliable (ESS = 4488)
  - The effect of moral (Median = -0.21, 95% CI [-0.25, -0.17]) has a 100.00% probability of being negative (< 0), 100.00% of being significant (< -0.04), and 3.35% of being large (< -0.25). The estimation successfully converged (Rhat = 1.000) and the
indices are reliable (ESS = 1481)
  - The effect of agency [Self] (Median = -0.20, 95% CI [-0.29, -0.11]) has a 100.00% probability of being negative (< 0), 99.95% of being significant (< -0.04), and 16.12% of being large (< -0.25). The estimation successfully converged (Rhat = 1.001) and
the indices are reliable (ESS = 4124)

Following the Sequential Effect eXistence and sIgnificance Testing (SEXIT) framework, we report the median of the posterior distribution and its 95% CI (Highest Density Interval), along the probability of direction (pd), the probability of significance and
the probability of being large. The thresholds beyond which the effect is considered as significant (i.e., non-negligible) and large are |0.04| and |0.25|. Convergence and stability of the Bayesian sampling has been assessed using R-hat, which should be
below 1.01 (Vehtari et al., 2019), and Effective Sample Size (ESS), which should be greater than 1000 (Burkner, 2017).
